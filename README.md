ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘Ÿ Fashion MNIST Classifier (CNN from Scratch)
ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Fashion MNIST contains 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items (10 classes such as T-shirts, trousers, shoes, bags).
Each image has a single object â†’ perfect for beginners.

The project demonstrates:

Building and training a CNN from scratch

Handling grayscale images in deep learning

Achieving ~90% test accuracy with a simple CNN

Comparing results with fully connected vs CNN models
